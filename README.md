# Creed's test bot

## Run

You can start the server by running `npm start`. However, the webhook must be at a public URL that the Facebook servers can reach. Therefore, running the server locally on your machine will not work.

You can run this example on a cloud service provider like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform or AWS. Note that webhooks must have a valid SSL certificate, signed by a certificate authority. Read more about setting up SSL for a [Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks#setup).

## Webhook

All webhook code is in `app.js`. It is routed to `/webhook`. This project handles callbacks for authentication, messages, delivery confirmation and postbacks. More details are available at the [reference docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference).
